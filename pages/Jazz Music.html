<p>Jazz is a musical style that originated at the beginning of the 20th century in African American communities in the
    Southern United States. It was born out of a mix of African and European music traditions. From its early
    development until the present, jazz has incorporated music from 19th and 20th century American popular music. Its
    West African pedigree is evident in its use of blue notes, improvisation, polyrhythms, syncopation, and the swung
    note.</p>

<h3>Scott Joplin</h3>

<p>Scott Joplin (ca. 1867 – April 1, 1917) was an American composer and pianist. Joplin achieved fame for his ragtime
    compositions, and was later dubbed “The King of Ragtime”. During his brief career, Joplin wrote 44 original ragtime
    pieces, one ragtime ballet, and two operas. One of his first pieces, the “Maple Leaf Rag”, became ragtime 's first
    and most influential hit, and has been recognized as the archetypal rag.</p>
<p>Joplin was born into a musical African American family of laborers in Northeast Texas, and developed his musical
    knowledge with the help of local teachers. During the late 1880s he travelled around the American South as an
    itinerant musician, and went to Chicago for the World’s Fair of 1893 which played a major part in making ragtime a
    national craze by 1897.Publication of his “Maple Leaf Rag” in 1899 brought him fame and had a profound influence on
    subsequent writers of ragtime. It also brought the composer a steady income for life with royalties of one cent per
    sale, equivalent to 26 cents per sale in current value.</p>
<p>During his lifetime, Joplin did not reach this level of success again and frequently had financial problems, which
    contributed to the loss of his first opera, A Guest of Honor. He continued to write ragtime compositions, and moved
    to New York in 1907. He attempted to go beyond the limitations of the musical form which made him famous, without
    much monetary success. His second opera, Treemonisha, was not received well at its partially staged performance in
    1915. He died from complications of tertiary syphilis in 1917.</p>
<p>Joplin’s music was rediscovered and returned to popularity in the early 1970s with the release of a million-selling
    album of Joplin’s rags recorded by Joshua Rifkin, followed by the Academy Award–winning movie The Sting which
    featured several of his compositions, such as “The Entertainer”. The opera Treemonisha was finally produced in full
    to wide acclaim in 1972. In 1976, Joplin was posthumously awarded a Pulitzer Prize.</p>

<h3>Louis Armstrong</h3>

<p>Louis Armstrong (August 4, 1901 – July 6, 1971), nicknamed Satchmoor Pops, was an American jazz trumpeter and singer
    from New Orleans, Louisiana. Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an “inventive” cornet and trumpet player,
    Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the music’s focus from collective improvisation to solo
    performance.</p>
<p>With his instantly recognizable deep and distinctive gravelly voice, resembling the sound of a trumpet, Armstrong was
    also an influential singer, demonstrating great dexterity as an improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song
    for expressive purposes. He was also greatly skilled at scat singing, vocalizing using sounds and syllables instead
    of actual lyrics.</p>
<p>Renowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice almost as much as for his trumpet-playing, Armstrong’s
    influence extends well beyond jazz music, and by the end of his career in the 1960s, he was widely regarded as a
    profound influence on popular music in general.</p>
<p>Armstrong was one of the first truly popular African-American entertainers to “cross over,” whose skin-color was
    secondary to his amazing talent in an America that was severely racially divided. It allowed him socially acceptable
    access to the upper echelons of American society that were highly restricted for a person of color. While he rarely
    publicly politicized his race, often to the dismay of fellow African-Americans, he was privately a strong supporter
    of the Civil Rights movement in America.</p>

<h3>Edward Kennedy 'duke' Ellington</h3>
<img src="/assets/media/image-10.jpg">
<p>Edward Kennedy “Duke” Ellington (April 29, 1899 – May 24, 1974) was an American composer, pianist, and big
    bandleader. Ellington wrote over 1,000 compositions. In the words of Bob Blumenthal of The Boston Globe “In the
    century since his birth, there has been no greater composer, American or otherwise, than Edward Kennedy Ellington.”
</p>
<p>A major figure in the history of jazz, Ellington’s music stretched into various other genres, including blues,
    gospel, film scores, popular, and classical. His career spanned more than 50 years and included leading his
    orchestra, composing an inexhaustible songbook, scoring for movies, composing stage musicals, and world tours.
    Several of his instrumental works were adapted into songs that became standards. Due to his inventive use of the
    orchestra, or big band, and thanks to his eloquence and extraordinary charisma, he is generally considered to have
    elevated the perception of jazz to an art form on a par with other traditional genres of music. His reputation
    increased after his death and the Pulitzer Prize Board bestowed on him a special posthumous honor in 1999.</p>
<p>Ellington called his music “American Music” rather than jazz, and liked to describe those who impressed him as
    “beyond category.” These included many of the musicians who were members of his orchestra, some of whom are
    considered among the best in jazz in their own right, but it was Ellington who melded them into one of the most
    well-known jazz orchestral units in the history of jazz. He often composed specifically for the style and skills of
    these individuals, such as “Jeep’s Blues” for Johnny Hodges, “Concerto for Cootie” for Cootie Williams, which later
    became “Do Nothing Till You Hear from Me” with Bob Russell’s lyrics, and “The Mooche” for Tricky Sam Nanton and
    Bubber Miley. He also recorded songs written by his bandsmen, such as Juan Tizol’s “Caravan” and “Perdido” which
    brought the ‘Spanish Tinge’ to big-band jazz. Several members of the orchestra remained there for several decades.
    After 1941, he frequently collaborated with composer-arranger-pianist Billy Strayhorn, whom he called his “writing
    and arranging companion.” Ellington recorded for many American record companies, and appeared in several films.</p>
<p>Ellington led his band from 1923 until he passed away in 1974. His son Mercer Ellington, who had already been
    handling all administrative aspects of his father’s business for several decades, led the band until his own death
    in 1996. At that point, the original band dissolved. Paul Ellington, Mercer’s youngest son and executor of the Duke
    Ellington estate, kept the Duke Ellington Orchestra going from Mercer’s death onwards.</p>
