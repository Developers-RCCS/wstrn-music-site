    The dates of the Classical Period in Western music
    are generally accepted as being between about 1750 and 1830. However, the term classical music is used
    colloquially to describe a variety of Western musical styles from the ninth century to the present, and
    especially from the sixteenth or seventeenth to the nineteenth. This is about the specific period from 1750 to
    1830.
</p>
<p>
    The Classical period falls between the Baroque and
    the Romantic periods. The best known composers from this period are Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,
    Ludwig van Beethoven, and Franz Schubert; other notable names include Luigi Boccherini, Muzio Clementi, Antonio
    Soler, Antonio Salieri, François Joseph Gossec, Johann Stamitz, Carl Friedrich Abel, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach,
    and Christoph Willibald Gluck. Ludwig van Beethoven is also sometimes regarded either as a Romantic composer or
    a composer who was part of the transition to the Romantic; Franz Schubert is also something of a transitional
    figure, as are Johann Nepomuk Hummel, Mauro Giuliani, Friedrich Kuhlau, Fernando Sor, Luigi Cherubini, Jan
    Ladislav Dussek, and Carl Maria von Weber. The period is sometimes referred to as the era of Viennese Classic or
    Classicism (German: Wiener Klassik), since Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Joseph Haydn, Antonio Salieri, and Ludwig
    van Beethoven all worked at some time in Vienna, and Franz Schubert were born there.

<img src="/assets/media/image-9.jpg"><img src="/assets/media/image-8.png">
<p>
    Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, full baptismal name
    Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart (27 January 1756 – 5 December 1791), was a prolific and
    influential composer of the Classical era. He composed over 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of
    symphonic, concert ante, chamber, piano, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of
    classical composers
</p>
<p>
    Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest
    childhood in Salzburg. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed
    before European royalty; at 17 he was engaged as a court musician in Salzburg, but grew restless and traveled in
    search of a better position, always composing abundantly. Visiting Vienna in 1781 he was dismissed from his
    Salzburg position and chose to stay in the capital, where over the rest of his life he achieved fame but little
    financial security. His final years in Vienna yielded many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas,
    and the Requiem. The circumstances of his early death have been much mythologized. He was survived by his wife
    Constanze and two sons.
</p>
<p>
    The central traits of the Classical style are all
    present in Mozart’s music. Clarity, balance, and transparency are the hallmarks of his work, but any simplistic
    notion of its delicacy masks the exceptional power of his finest masterpieces, such as the Piano Concerto No. 24
    in C minor, K. 491, the Symphony No. 40 in G minor, K.550, and the opera Don Giovanni.

<a id="Ludwig van Beethoven"></a><h3>Ludwig van Beethoven</h3>
<img src="/assets/media/image-7.jpg">
<p>
    Ludwig van Beethoven (17 December 1770 – 26 March
    1827) was a German composer and pianist. He was a crucial figure in the transitional period between the
    Classical and Romantic eras in Western classical music, and remains one of the most acclaimed and influential
    composers of all time.
</p>
<p>
    Born in Bonn, of the Electorate of Cologne and a
    part of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation in present-day Germany, he moved to Vienna in his early
    twenties and settled there, studying with Joseph Haydn and quickly gaining a reputation as a virtuoso pianist.
    His hearing began to deteriorate in the late 1790s, yet he continued to compose, conduct, and perform, even
    after becoming completely deaf.
</p>
<p>
    In his early period, Beethoven’s work was strongly
    influenced by his predecessors Haydn and Mozart. He also explored new directions and gradually expanded the
    scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the Early period are the first and second symphonies,
    the set of six string quartets Opus 18, the first two piano concertos, and the first dozen or so piano sonatas,
    including the famous Pathétique sonata, Op. 13.
</p>
<p>
    His Middle (Heroic) period began shortly after
    Beethoven’s personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness. It includes large-scale works
    that express heroism and struggle. Middle-period works include six symphonies (Nos. 3–8), the last three piano
    concertos, the Triple Concerto and violin concerto, five string quartets (Nos. 7–11), several piano sonatas
    (including the Moonlight, Waldstein and Appassionata sonatas), the Kreutzer violin sonata and Beethoven’s only
    opera, Fidelio.
</p>
<p>
    Beethoven’s late period began around 1815. Works
    from this period are characterized by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense,
    highly personal expression. The String Quartet, Op. 131 has seven linked movements, and the Ninth Symphony adds
    choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement. Other compositions from this period include the Missa
    Solemnis, the last five string quartets (including the massive Große Fuge) and the last five piano sonatas.

<img src="/assets/media/image-6.jpg">
<p>
    Franz Joseph Haydn (31 March 1732 – 31 May 1809),
    known as Joseph Haydn was an Austrian composer, one of the most prolific and prominent composers of the
    Classical period. He is often called the “Father of the Symphony” and “Father of the String Quartet” because of
    his important contributions to these forms. He was also instrumental in the development of the piano trio and in
    the evolution of sonata form.
</p>
<p>
    A lifelong resident of Austria, Haydn spent much of
    his career as a court musician for the wealthy Esterházy family on their remote estate. Isolated from other
    composers and trends in music until the later part of his long life, he was, as he put it, “forced to become
    original”. At the time of his death, he was one of the most celebrated composers in Europe.
</p>
<p>
    Joseph Haydn was the brother of Michael Haydn,
    himself a highly regarded composer, and Johann Evangelist Haydn, a tenor. He was also a very close friend of
    Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and a teacher of Ludwig van Beethoven.
