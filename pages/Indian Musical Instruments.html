<p>India’s classical tradition has a variety of musical instruments that reflect original creativity, adaptive
    innovation and assimilation. The Veena, the venu (the flute) and the drum find mention in the Vedas. The Sitar and
    the tabla have been innovated under Persian influence. The West’s violin has been assimilated into Carnatic music so
    completely that it is today as integral to it as the veena. Even the mandolin has been welcomed into Indian
    classical music. Carnatic music is a system of music commonly associated with the southern part of the India. It is
    one of two main sub-genres of Indian classical music that evolved from ancient Hindu traditions.</p>
<a id="Veena"></a>
<h3>Veena</h3>

<p>Veena is a plucked stringed instrument used mostly in Carnatic Indian classical music. There are several variations
    of the veena, which in its South Indian form is a member of the lute family. One who plays the veena is referred to
    as a vainika.</p>
<a id="Sitar"></a>
<h3>Sitar</h3>

<p>The Sitar is a plucked stringed instrument predominantly used in Hindustani classical music, where it has been
    ubiquitous since the Middle Ages. It derives its resonance from sympathetic strings, a long hollow neck and a gourd
    resonating chamber.</p>
<a id="Thampura"></a>
<h3>Thampura</h3>

<p>Under laying the sounds of the ragas and the talas is the drone sound of the Thampura. It’s actually a lute, usually
    with four (or five) metal strings. It has no fret – pieces of materials such as wool and silk are placed between the
    string to achieve the required pitch. The Thampura plays a crucial part in performance. It’s from its pitch that all
    performers take their cue.</p>
<a id="Esraj"></a>
<h3>Esraj</h3>

<p>The esraj (Bengali: এস্রাজ; Hindi: इसराज; also called israj) is a string instrument found in two forms throughout the
    north, central, and east regions of India. It is a young instrument by Indian terms, being only about 200 years old.
    The dilruba is found in the north, where it is used in religious music and light classical songs in the urban areas.
    Its name is translated as “robber of the heart.” The esraj is found in the east and central areas, particularly
    Bengal (Bangladesh and Indian states of West Bengal and Tripura) and it is used in a somewhat wider variety of
    musical styles than is the dilruba.</p>
<a id="Tabla"></a>
<h3>Tabla</h3>

<p>The tabla (or tabl, tabla) is a popular Indian percussioninstrument (of the membranophone family), similar to bongos,
    used in Hindustani classical music and in popular and devotional music of the Indian subcontinent. The instrument
    consists of a pair of hand drums of contrasting sizes and timbres. The term 'tabla is derived from an Arabic word,
    tabl, which simply means “drum.” Playing technique involves extensive use of the fingers and palms in various
    configurations to create a wide variety of different sounds, reflected in the mnemonic syllables (bol). The heel of
    the hand is used to apply pressure or in a sliding motion on the larger drum so that the pitch is changed during the
    sound’s decay.</p>
<a id="Dilruba"></a>
<h3>Dilruba</h3>

<p>The Dilruba originates from the Taus and some argue is the work of the 10th Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, whilst that
    of the Taus was the work of Guru Hargobind (the sixth guru of the Sikhs). The Dilruba was then produced to replace
    the previously heavy instrument (the Taus). This attempt was intended to ‘scale down’ the Taus into what is now
    known to be the Dilruba. This made it more convenient for the Sikh army to carry the instrument on horseback.</p>
