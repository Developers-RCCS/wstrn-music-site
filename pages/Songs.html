<a id="South of the Border"></a><h3>South of the Border</h3>
<p>South of the border - down Mexico way</p>
<p>That’s where I fell in love, where the stars above - came out to play</p>
<p>And now as I wander - my thoughts</p>
<p>ever stray</p>
<p>South of the border - down Mexico way</p>
<p>She was a picture - in old Spanish lace</p>
<p>Just for a tender while, I kissed a smile - upon her face</p>
<p>'Cause it was fiesta - and we were so gay</p>
<p>South of the border - Mexico way</p>
<p>Then she smiled as she whispered</p>
<p>“manjanna”</p>
<p>Never dreaming that we were parting</p>
<p>Then I lied as a whispered</p>
<p>“manjanna”</p>
<p>'Cause our tomorrow never came</p>
<p>South of the border - I jumped back one day</p>
<p>There in a veil of white, by the candle light - she knelt to pray</p>
<p>The mission bells told me (ding-dong)</p>
<ul>
<li>that I musn’t stay<br>
South of the border - Mexico way</li>
</ul>
<a id="Jamaican Farewell"></a><h3>Jamaican Farewell</h3>
<p>Down the way where the nights are gay</p>
<p>And the sun shines daily on the mountain top</p>
<p>I took a trip on a sailing ship</p>
<p>And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop</p>
<p>CHORUS:</p>
<p>But I’m sad to say, I’m on my way</p>
<p>Won’t be back for many a day</p>
<p>My heart is down, my head is turning around</p>
<p>I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town</p>
<p>Sounds of laughter everywhere</p>
<p>And the dancing girls swaying to and fro</p>
<p>I must declare that my heart is there Though I’ve been from Maine to Mexico</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<a id="Its a Long Way to Tipperary"></a><h3>It’s a Long Way to Tipperary</h3>
<p>It’s a long way to Tipperary,</p>
<p>It’s a long way to go.</p>
<p>It’s a long way to Tipperary</p>
<p>To the sweetest girl I know!</p>
<p>Goodbye, Piccadilly,</p>
<p>Farewell, Leicester Square!</p>
<p>It’s a long long way to Tipperary,</p>
<p>But my heart’s right</p>
<a id="Country Roads"></a><h3>Country Roads</h3>
<p>Almost heaven, West Virginia</p>
<p>Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River</p>
<p>Life is old there, older than the trees</p>
<p>Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze</p>
<p>Country roads, take me home</p>
<p>To the place I belong</p>
<p>West Virginia, mountain mama</p>
<p>Take me home, country roads</p>
<p>All my memories gather 'round her</p>
<p>Miner’s lady, stranger to blue water</p>
<p>Dark and dusty, painted on the sky</p>
<p>Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye</p>
<p>Country roads, take me home</p>
<p>To the place I belong</p>
<p>West Virginia, mountain mama</p>
<p>Take me home, country roads</p>
<p>I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me</p>
<p>The radio reminds me of my home far away</p>
<p>Driving down the road, I get a feeling</p>
<p>That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday</p>
<p>Country roads, take me home</p>
<p>To the place I belong</p>
<p>West Virginia, mountain mama</p>
<p>Take me home, country roads</p>
<p>Country roads, take me home</p>
<p>To the place I belong</p>
<p>West Virginia, mountain mama</p>
<p>Take me home, country roads</p>
<p>Take me home, down country roads</p>
<p>Take me home, down country roads</p>
<a id="You Raise Me Up"></a><h3>You Raise Me Up</h3>
<p>When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary;</p>
<p>When troubles come and my heart burdened be;</p>
<p>Then, I am still and wait here in the silence,</p>
<p>Until you come and sit awhile with me.</p>
<p>You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;</p>
<p>You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;</p>
<p>I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;</p>
<p>You raise me up: To more than I can be.</p>
<p>You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;</p>
<p>You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;</p>
<p>I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;</p>
<p>You raise me up: To more than I can be.</p>
<p>There is no life - no life without its hunger;</p>
<p>Each restless heart beats so imperfectly;</p>
<p>But when you come and I am filled with wonder,</p>
<p>Sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity.</p>
<p>You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;</p>
<p>You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;</p>
<p>I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;</p>
<p>You raise me up: To more than I can be.</p>
<p>You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;</p>
<p>You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;</p>
<p>I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;</p>
<p>You raise me up: To more than I can be.</p>
