<h3>Pitch</h3>
<p>Pitch is an auditory perceptual property that allows the ordering of sounds on a frequency-related scale. Pitches are
    compared as “higher” and “lower” in the sense associated with musical melodies, which require “sound whose frequency
    is clear and stable enough to be heard as not noise”.</p>
<p>E.g. Middle C = 256 Hz</p>
<p>Concert Pitch A = 440 Hz</p>

<h3>Duration</h3>
<p>In music duration is an amount of time or a particular time interval. It is the length of a note. Duration is a
    property of a note that becomes one of the bases of rhythm.</p>

<h3>Loudness</h3>
<p>Loudness is the quality of a sound that is primarily a psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude).</p>
<a id="Timbre"></a>
<h3>Timbre</h3>
<p>In music, timbre, also known as tone color,is the quality of a musical note or sound or tone that distinguishes
    various types of sound production, such as voices and musical instruments, string instruments, wind instruments, and
    percussion instruments.</p>
<a id="The Human Ear"></a>
<h3>The Human Ear</h3>

<p>The outer part of the ear collects sound. That sound pressure is amplified through the middle portion of the ear and,
    in land animals, passed from the medium of air into a liquid medium. The change from air to liquid occurs because
    air surrounds the head and is contained in the ear canal and middle ear, but not in the inner ear. The inner ear is
    hollow, embedded in the temporal bone, the densest bone of the body.</p>
<p>The three smallest bones in the human body are found in the middle ear</p>
<p>• Malleus (Hammer)</p>
<p>• Incus (Anvil)</p>
<p>• Stapes (Stirrups)</p>
