<h3>March</h3>
<p>A march, as a musical genre, is a piece of music with a strong regular rhythm which in origin was expressly written
    for marching to and most frequently performed by a military band.Marches can be written in any time signature, but
    the most common time signatures are 4/4, 2/2 (alla breve, although this may refer to 2 time up until the time of
    Johannes Brahms, or cut time), 6/8, and 3/4; however, some modern marches are being written in 1/2 time. The modern
    march tempo hovers around 120 beats to the minute (the standard Napoleonic march tempo); however, many funeral
    marches conform to the Roman standard of 60 beats to the minute.</p>

    beat.</p>
