<a id="String Instruments"></a><h2>String Instruments</h2>
<img src="assets/media/image-46.png">
<p>The four major instruments in the string family, the violin, the viola, the cello and the double bass, are built the
    same way. The instruments are made of many pieces of wood which are glued - never nailed - together. The body of the
    instrument is hollow, thus becoming a resonating box for the sound. Four strings (sometimes five on the double-bass)
    made of animal gut, nylon, or steel are wrapped around pegs at one end of the instrument and attached to a tailpiece
    at the other. They are stretched tightly across a bridge to produce their assigned pitches.</p>

<a id="Violin"></a><h4>Violin</h4>
<p>• The Violin is the soprano voice in the string family. It is held under the chin, resting on the shoulder. The
    violin has a very lovely tone that can be soft and expressive or exciting and brilliant. It is also known as the
    ―Cinderella‖ of the orchestra. Its strings are tuned to G, D, A, and E.</p>

<a id="Viola"></a><h4>Viola</h4>
<p>• The Viola is the alto voice in the string family. Like the violin, it is held under the chin, resting on the
    shoulder. </p>
<p>Unlike the violin, the viola is slightly larger and is tuned five notes lower. It has a darker and warmer tone
    quality than the violin, but is not as brilliant. Its strings are tuned to C, G, D and A.</p>

<a id="Violoncello"></a><h4>Violoncello</h4>
<p>• The Violoncello or Cello is the tenor voice in the string family. While shaped like a violin, the cello is much
    larger and is held between the player’s knees. Because it can produce beautiful sounds from its lowest to its
    highest notes, it is a popular instrument. Its strings are tuned to C, G, D and A in the bass clef.</p>

<a id="Double Bass"></a><h4>Double Bass</h4>
<p>• The Double Bass or string bass is the largest and lowest instrument of the string family. The double bass has
    rounded shoulders instead of square shoulders like the other string instruments. Because of its size, the player
    stands or sits on a high </p>
<p>stool to play it. It is a transposing instrument. Its strings are tuned to E, A, D and G.</p>

<a id="Plucked String Instruments"></a><h3>Plucked String Instruments</h3>
<a id="Banjo"></a><h4>Banjo</h4>
<p>• The banjo is a four or five stringed instrument with a piece of plastic or animal skin stretched over a circular
    frame. Simpler forms of the instrument were fashioned by enslaved Africans in Colonial America, adapted from several
    African instruments of the same basic design. The banjo is usually associated with country, folk, Irish traditional
    music and bluegrass music. Historically, the banjo occupied a central place in African traditional music, before
    becoming popular in the minstrel shows of the 19th century. In fact, blacks influenced early development of the
    music that became country and bluegrass, through the introduction of the banjo and through the innovation of musical
    techniques for both the banjo and fiddle. The banjo, with the fiddle, is a mainstay of American old-time music.</p>
<a id="Guitar"></a><h4>Guitar</h4>
<p>• The guitar is a plucked string instrument, usually played with fingers or a pick. The guitar consists of a body
    with a rigid neck to which the strings, generally six in number, are attached. Guitars are traditionally constructed
    of various woods and strung with animal gut or, more recently, with either nylon or steel strings. Some modern
    guitars are made of polycarbonate materials. Guitars are made and repaired by luthiers. There are two primary
    families of guitars: acoustic and electric.</p>
<a id="Lute"></a><h4>Lute</h4>
<p>• Lute can refer generally to any plucked string instrument with a neck (either fretted or unfretted) and a deep
    round back, or more specifically to an instrument from the family of European lutes.The European lute and the modern
    Near-Eastern oud both descend from a common ancestor via diverging evolutionary paths. The lute is used in a great
    variety of instrumental music from the Medieval to the late Baroque eras and was probably the most important
    instrument for secular music in the Renaissance. It is also an accompanying instrument, especially in vocal works,
    often realizing a basso continuo or playing a written-out accompaniment.The player of a lute is called a lutenist,
    lutanist or lutist, and a maker of lutes (or any string instrument) is referred to as a luthier.</p>
<a id="Harp"></a><h4>Harp</h4>
<p>• The harp is a multi-stringed instrument which has the plane of its strings positioned perpendicularly to the
    soundboard. Organologically, it is in the general category of chordophones (stringed instruments) and has its own
    sub category (the harps). All harps have a neck, resonator and strings. Some, known as frame harps, also have a
    pillar; those without the pillar are referred to as open harps. Depending on its size, which varies, a harp may be
    played while held in the lap or while it stands on a table, or on the floor. Harp strings may be made of nylon, gut,
    wire or silk. On smaller harps, </p>
<p>like the folk harp, the core string material will typically be the same for all strings on a given harp. Larger
    instruments like the modern concert harp mix string materials to attain their </p>
<p>extended ranges. A person who plays the harp is called a harpist or harper. Folk musicians often use the term
    “harper”, whereas classical musicians use “harpist”.</p>
<a id="Mandolin"></a><h4>Mandolin</h4>
<p>• A mandolin is a musical instrument in the lute family (plucked, or strummed). It descends from the mandore, a
    soprano member of the lute family. The mandolin soundboard (the top) comes in many shapes—but generally round or
    teardrop-shaped, sometimes with scrolls or other projections. A </p>
<p>mandolin may have f-holes, or a single round or oval sound hole. A </p>
<p>round or oval sound hole may be bordered with decorative rosettes or purfling, but usually does not feature an
    intricately carved grille like a Baroque era mandolin. Early mandolins had six double courses of gut strings, tuned
    similarly to lutes, and plucked with the fingertips. Modern mandolins—which originated in Naples, Italy in the late
    18th century—commonly have four double courses (four pairs) of metal strings, which are plucked with a plectrum.</p>
