<p>Romantic music is a term describing a style of Western classical music that existed roughly from 1810 to 1900. It
    formed part and parcel of Romanticism, the artistic and literary movement that arose in the second half of the 18th
    century in Europe.</p>
<p>Romantic music as a movement evolved from the formats, genres and musical ideas established in earlier periods, such
    as the classical period, and went further in the name of expression and syncretism of different art-forms with
    music. Romanticism does not necessarily refer to romantic love, though that theme was prevalent in many works
    composed during this time period, both in literature, painting, or music. Romanticism followed a path that led to
    the expansion of formal structures for a composition set down or at least created in their general outlines in
    earlier periods, and the end-result is that the pieces are “understood” to be more passionate and expressive, both
    by 19th century and today’s audiences. Because of the expansion of form (those elements pertaining to form, key,
    instrumentation and the like) within a typical composition, and the growing idiosyncrasies and expressiveness of the
    new composers from the new century, it became easier to identify an artist based on his work or style.</p>
<p>Romantic music attempted to increase emotional expression and power to describe deeper truths or human feelings,
    while preserving but in many cases extending the formal structures from the classical period, in others, creating
    new forms that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter. The subject matter in the new music was now not
    only purely abstract, but also frequently drawn from other art-form sources such as literature or history
    (historical figures) or nature itself</p>

<img src="assets/media/image-26.jpg"><img src="assets/media/image-25.png">
<p>Franz Peter Schubert (January 31, 1797 – November 19, 1828) was an Austrian composer. He wrote some 600 Lieder, nine
    symphonies (including the famous “Unfinished Symphony”), liturgical music, operas, some incidental music, and a
    large body of chamber and solo piano music. He is particularly noted for his original melodic and harmonic writing.
</p>
<p>Schubert was born into a musical family, and received formal musical training through much of his childhood.</p>
<p>While Schubert had a close circle of friends and associates who admired his work (amongst them the prominent singer
    Johann Michael Vogl), wide appreciation of his music during his lifetime was limited at best. He was never able to
    secure adequate permanent employment, and for most of his career he relied on the support of friends and family. He
    made some money from published works, and occasionally gave private musical instruction. In the last year of his
    life he began to receive wider acclaim. He died at the age of 31 of typhoid fever.</p>
<p>Interest in Schubert’s work increased dramatically in the decades following his death. Composers like Franz Liszt,
    Robert Schumann and Felix Mendelssohn discovered, collected, and championed his works in the 19th century, as did
    musicologist Sir George Grove. Franz Schubert is now widely considered to be one of the greatest composers in the
    Western tradition.</p>
<a id="Frdric Chopin 20"></a><h3>Frédéric Chopin</h3>
<img src="assets/media/image-28.jpg"><img src="assets/media/image-27.png">
<p>Frédéric François Chopin (1 March 1810 – 17 October 1849) was a Polishcomposer and virtuosopianist. He was one of the
    great masters of Romantic music.</p>
<p>Chopin was born in the village of Żelazowa Wola, in the Duchy of Warsaw, to a French-expatriate father and Polish
    mother and was regarded as a child-prodigy pianist. On 2 November 1830, at the age of twenty, he left Warsaw for
    Austria, intending to go on to Italy. The outbreak of the Polish November Uprising seven days later, and its
    subsequent suppression by Russia, led to Chopin’s becoming one of many expatriates of the Polish Great Emigration.
</p>
<p>In Paris, Chopin made a comfortable living as a composer and piano teacher, while giving few public performances.
    Though an ardent Polish patriot, in France he used the French versions of his names and eventually, to avoid having
    to rely on Imperial Russian documents, became a French citizen. After some ill-fated romantic involvements with
    Polish women, from 1837 to 1847 he had a turbulent relationship with the French authoressGeorge Sand. Always in
    frail health, he died in Paris in 1849, aged thirty-nine, of pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>The series of seven Polonaises published in his lifetime (another nine were published posthumously), beginning with
    the Op. 26 pair, set a new standard for music in the form, and were rooted in Chopin’s desire to write something to
    celebrate Polish culture after the countryhad fallen into Russian control. The Polonaise in A major, Op. 40, No. 1,
    the “Military,” and the Polonaise in A-flat major, Op. 53, the “Heroic,” are among Chopin’s best-loved and
    most-often-played works.</p>
<a id="Felix Mendelssohn"></a><h3>Felix Mendelssohn</h3>
<img src="assets/media/image-23.jpg">
<p>Jakob Ludwig Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, born, and generally known in English-speaking countries, as Felix
    Mendelssohn(February 3, 1809 – November 4, 1847) was a Germancomposer, pianist, organist and conductor of the early
    Romantic period.</p>
<p>The grandson of the philosopherMoses Mendelssohn, he was born into a </p>
<p>notable Jewishfamily, although he himself was brought up initially without religion, and later as a Lutheran. He was
    recognized early as a musical prodigy, but his parents were cautious and did not seek to capitalize on his
    abilities. Indeed his father was disinclined to allow Felix to follow a musical career until it became clear that he
    intended to seriously dedicate himself to it.</p>
<p>Early success in Germany was followed by travel throughout Europe; Mendelssohn was particularly well received in
    England as a composer, conductor and soloist, and his ten visits there, during which many of his major works were
    premiered, form an important part of his adult career. His essentially conservative musical tastes however set him
    apart from many of his more adventurous musical contemporaries such as Liszt, Wagner and Berlioz. The Conservatory
    he founded at Leipzig became a bastion of this anti-radical outlook.</p>
<p>The Symphony No. 1 in C minor for full-scale orchestra was written in 1824, when Mendelssohn was aged 15. The
    incidental music to A Midsummer Night’s Dream (Op. 61), including the well-known Wedding March, was written in 1843,
    seventeen years after the overture. The hymn tune Mendelssohn—an adaptation by William Hayman Cummings of a melody
    from Mendelssohn’s cantata ‗Festgesang’—is the standard tune for Charles Wesley’s popular hymn ‘Hark! The Herald
    Angels Sing’</p>
<a id="Robert Schumann"></a><h3>Robert Schumann</h3>
<img src="assets/media/image-38.jpg"><img src="assets/media/image-37.png">
<p>Robert Schumann, sometimes given as Robert Alexander Schumann, (8 June 1810 – </p>
<p>29 July 1856) was a German composer, aesthete and influential music critic. He is one of the most famous and
    important Romantic composers of the 19th century.</p>
<p>He had hoped to pursue a career as a virtuoso pianist, having been assured by his teacher Friedrich Wieck that he
    could become the finest pianist in Europe only after a few years of study with him. However, a self-inflicted hand
    injury prevented those hopes from being realized, and he decided to focus his musical energies on composition.
    Schumann’s published compositions were all for the piano until 1840; he later composed works for piano and
    orchestra, many lieder (songs for voice and piano), four symphonies, an opera, and other orchestral, choral and
    chamber works. His writings about music appeared mostly in the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik (“The New Journal for
    Music”), a Leipzig-based publication that he jointly founded.</p>
<p>In 1840, after a long and acrimonious legal battle with his piano instructor (Wieck), Schumann married Wieck’s
    daughter, pianist Clara Wieck, who also composed music and had a considerable concert career, including premieres of
    many of her husband’s works. Robert Schumann died in middle age; for the last two years of his life, after an
    attempted suicide, he was confined to a mental institution at his own request. Carnaval (Op. 9, 1834) is one of
    Schumann’s most genial and characteristic piano works. Schumann begins nearly every section of Carnaval with the
    musical notes signified in German by the letters that spell Asch (A, E-flat, C, and B, or alternatively A-flat, C,
    and B; in German these are A, Es, C and H, and As C and H respectively), the town (then in Bohemia, now in the Czech
    Republic) in which Ernestine was born, and the notes are also the musical letters in Schumann’s own name.</p>
<a id="Franz Liszt"></a><h3>Franz Liszt</h3>
<img src="assets/media/image-24.jpg">
<p>Franz Liszt (Hungarian: Ferencz Liszt, in modern usage Ferenc Liszt, from 1859 to 1865 officially Franz Ritter von
    Liszt) (October 22, 1811 – July 31, 1886) was a Hungariancomposer, virtuosopianist and teacher.</p>
<p>He was also the father-in-law of Richard Wagner. Liszt became renowned throughout Europe during the 19th century for
    his great skill as a performer. He was said by his contemporaries to have been the most technically advanced pianist
    of his age and perhaps the greatest pianist of all time. He was also an important and influential composer, a
    notable piano teacher, a conductor who contributed significantly to the modern development of the art, and a
    benefactor to other composers and performers, notably Richard Wagner, Hector Berlioz, Camille Saint-Saëns, Edvard
    Grieg and Alexander Borodin.</p>
<p>As a composer, Liszt was one of the most prominent representatives of the “Neudeutsche Schule” (“NewGermanSchool”).
    He left behind a huge and diverse body of work, in which he influenced his forward- looking contemporaries and
    anticipated some 20th-century ideas and trends. Some of his most notable contributions were the invention of the
    symphonic poem, developing the concept of thematic transformation as part of his experiments in musical form and
    making radical departures in harmony.</p>
<p>Liszt’s piano works are usually divided into two classes. On the one hand, there are “original works”, and on the
    other hand “transcriptions”, “paraphrases” or “fantasies” on works by other composers. Examples for the first class
    are works such as the piece Harmonies poétiques et religieuses of May 1833 and the Piano Sonata in B minor. Liszt’s
    transcriptions of Schubert songs, his fantasies on operatic melodies, and his piano arrangements of symphonies by
    Berlioz and Beethoven are examples for the second class. As special case, Liszt also made piano arrangements of own
    instrumental and vocal works. Examples of this kind are the arrangement of the second movement “Gretchen” of his
    Faust Symphony and the first “Mephisto Waltz” as well as the “Liebesträume No. 3” and the two volumes of his “Buch
    der Lieder”.</p>
<a id="Giuseppe Verdi"></a><h3>Giuseppe Verdi</h3>
<img src="assets/media/image-29.jpg">
<p>Giuseppe Fortunino Francesco Verdi (October 9 or 10, 1813 – January 27, 1901) was an Italian Romanticcomposer, mainly
    of opera. He was one of the most influential composers of the 19th century. His works are frequently performed in
    opera houses throughout the world and, transcending the boundaries of the genre, some of his themes have long since
    taken root in popular culture - such as “La donna è mobile” from Rigoletto, “Va, pensiero” (The Chorus of the Hebrew
    Slaves) from Nabucco, “Libiamo ne’ lieti calici” (The Drinking Song) from La traviata and Triumphal March from Aida.
</p>
<p>Although his work was sometimes criticized for using a generally diatonic rather than a chromatic musical idiom and
    having a tendency toward melodrama, Verdi’s masterworks dominate the standard repertoire a century and a half after
    their composition.</p>
<p>Unlike most of the visual arts, opera was commercially profitable, accessible to most classes of society, and thus an
    effective means of reaching the nineteenth- century public. Verdi used musical theater to contrast noble ideals with
    the corrosive effects of power, love of country with the inevitable call for sacrifice and death, and the lure of
    passion with the need for social order.</p>
<a id="Richard Wagner"></a><h3>Richard Wagner</h3>
<img src="assets/media/image-36.jpg"><img src="assets/media/image-35.png">
<p>Wilhelm Richard Wagner (22 May 1813 – 13 February 1883) was a Germancomposer, conductor, theatre director and
    essayist, primarily known for his operas (or “music dramas”, as they were later called). Unlike most other opera
    composers, Wagner wrote both the music and libretto for every one of his works.</p>
<p>Wagner’s compositions, particularly those of his later period, are notable for contrapuntaltexture, rich
    chromaticism, harmonies and orchestration, and elaborate use of leitmotifs: musical themes associated with
    particular characters, locales or plot elements. Wagner pioneered advances in musical language, such as extreme
    chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres, which greatly influenced the development of European classical
    music.</p>
<p>He transformed musical thought through his idea of Gesamtkunstwerk (“total artwork”), the synthesis of all the
    poetic, visual, musical and dramatic arts, epitomized by his monumental four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen
    (1876). To try to stage these works as he imagined them, Wagner built his own opera house, the Bayreuth
    Festspielhaus.</p>
<p>Wagner’s three completed early-stage operas are Die Feen (The Fairies), Das Liebesverbot (The Ban on Love), and
    Rienzi. Wagner’s middle stage output is considered to be of remarkably higher quality, and starts to show the
    deepening of his powers as a dramatist and composer.</p>
<p>This period began with Der fliegende Holländer (The Flying Dutchman), followed by Tannhäuser and Lohengrin. These
    works are widely performed today. Some are of the opinion that Tristan und Isolde (Tristan and Iseult) is Wagner’s
    greatest single opera.</p>
<a id="Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky"></a><h3>Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky</h3>
<img src="assets/media/image-34.jpg"><img src="assets/media/image-33.png">
<p>Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky[a 1] (7 May 1840– 6 November 1893) often called Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky in English, was a
    Russian composer of the Romantic era. He wrote some of the most popular concert and theatrical music in the current
    classical repertoire, including the ballets Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker, the 1812 Overture,
    his First Piano Concerto, seven symphonies, and the opera Eugene Onegin.</p>
<p>Tchaikovsky was born into a middle-class family. His education prepared him for a career as a civil servant, despite
    the musical precocity he had demonstrated. Against the wishes of his family he chose to pursue a musical career, and
    in 1862 entered the St Petersburg Conservatory, graduating in 1865. This formal, Western-oriented training set him
    apart, musically, from the contemporary nationalistic movement embodied by the group of young Russian composers
    known as “The Five”, with whom Tchaikovsky sustained a mixed professional relationship throughout his career.</p>
<p>As his style developed, Tchaikovsky wrote music across a range of genres, including symphony, opera, ballet,
    instrumental, chamber and song. Although he enjoyed many popular successes, he was never emotionally secure, and his
    life was punctuated by personal crises and periods of depression. Contributory factors were his suppressed
    homosexuality and fear of exposure, his disastrous marriage, and the sudden collapse of the one enduring
    relationship of his adult life, his 13-year association with the wealthy widow Nadezhda von Meck. Amid private
    turmoil Tchaikovsky’s public reputation grew; he was honored by the Tsar, awarded a lifetime pension and lauded in
    the concert halls of the world. His sudden death at the age of 53 is generally ascribed to cholera, but some
    attribute it to suicide.</p>
<a id="Hector Berlioz"></a><h3>Hector Berlioz</h3>
<img src="assets/media/image-30.jpg">
<p>Hector Berlioz (December 11, 1803 – March 8, 1869) was a French Romanticcomposer, best known for his compositions
    Symphonie fantastique and Grande Messe des morts (Requiem). Berlioz made significant contributions to the modern
    orchestra with his Treatise on Instrumentation.</p>
<p>He specified huge orchestral forces for some of his works; as a conductor, he performed several concerts with more
    than 1,000 musicians. He also composed around 50 songs.</p>
<p>While Berlioz is best known as a composer, he was also a prolific writer, and supported himself for many years by
    writing musical criticism, utilizing a bold, vigorous style, at times imperious and sarcastic. He wrote for many
    journals, including Le Rénovateur, Journal des débats and Gazette musicale.</p>
<a id="Maurice Ravel"></a><h3>Maurice Ravel</h3>
<img src="assets/media/image-32.jpg">
<p>Joseph-Maurice Ravel (March 7, 1875 – December 28, 1937) was a French composer of Impressionist music known
    especially for his melodies, orchestral and instrumental textures and effects. Much of his piano music, chamber
    music, vocal music and orchestral music has entered the standard concert repertoire.</p>
<p>Ravel’s piano compositions, such as Jeux d’eau, Miroirs and Gaspard de la Nuit, demand considerable virtuosity from
    the performer, and his orchestral music, including Daphnis et Chloé and his arrangement of Modest Mussorgsky’s
    Pictures at an Exhibition, uses a variety of sound and instrumentation very effectively.</p>
<p>Ravel is perhaps known best for his orchestral work, Boléro (1928), which he considered trivial and once described as
    “a piece for orchestra without music.” According to SACEM, Ravel’s estate earns more royalties than that of any
    other French musician. According to international copyright law, Ravel’s works are public domain since January 1,
    2008 in most countries. In France, due to anomalous copyright law extensions to account for the two world wars, they
    will not enter the public domain until 2015.</p>
<a id="Johannes Brahms"></a><h3>Johannes Brahms</h3>
<img src="assets/media/image-31.png">
<p>He was born in Germany. At 13th age he led a doubled life. During the day he studied piano, theory and compositions;
    at night he played dance music in cafes. Brahms wanted to become a conductor of the philharmonic orchestra. He
    conducted Viennese Music Society and introduced many forgotten works of Bach, Handle and Mozart. He had a wide
    knowledge od older music. Edited Baroque and Classical compositions and collected music manuscript.</p>
<p>He was no orchestral virtuoso although he had as keen an appreciation of tone color as most of his contemporaries. He
    rarely insisted on sound as such. It was the music itself on which he focuses our attention.</p>
<p>He was a first-rate pianist and most of his works for the instruments are of considerable technical difficulty. He
    does not believe in flashy display and the most difficult or brilliant passages are therefore an integral part of
    his work. The same applies even to the far from easy Violin Concerto. In these songs, more importance is given to
    the melody than the voice while not by any means reducing the piano part to a mere subordinate accompaniment. He
    tends overall to tip the balance in favors of the voice</p>
<a id="Claude Debussy"></a><h3>Claude Debussy</h3>
<img src="assets/media/image-22.jpg">
<p>Claude Debussy ( 22 August 1862 – 25 March 1918 ) was a French composer. He is sometimes seem as the first
    impressionist composer. He was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and 20th centuries. Born to a
    family of modest means and little cultural involvement, Debussy showed enough musical talent to be admitted at the
    age of ten to France’s leading music college, the Conservatoire de Paris. He originally studied the piano, but found
    his vocation in innovative composition, despite the disapproval of the Conservatoire’s conservative professors. He
    took many years to develop his mature style, and was nearly 40 when he achieved international fame in 1902 with the
    only opera he completed, Pelléas et Mélisande.</p>
<p>Debussy’s orchestral works include Prélude à l’après-midi d’un faune (1894), Nocturnes (1897–1899) and Images
    (1905–1912). His music was to a considerable extent a reaction against Wagner and the German musical tradition. He
    regarded the classical symphony as obsolete and sought an alternative in his “symphonic sketches”, La mer
    (1903–1905). His piano works include two books of Préludes and two of Études. Throughout his career he wrote
    mélodies based on a wide variety of poetry, including his own.</p>
<p>With early influences including Russian and far-eastern music, Debussy developed his own style of harmony and
    orchestral colouring, derided – and unsuccessfully resisted by much of the musical establishment of the day. His
    works have strongly influenced a wide range of composers including Béla Bartók, Olivier Messiaen, George Benjamin,
    and the jazz pianist and composer Bill Evans. Debussy passed away from cancer at his home in Paris at the age of 55
    after a composing career of a little more than 30 years.</p>
