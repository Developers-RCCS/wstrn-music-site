<p>With a name that means, “The hitting of one body against another,” instruments in the percussion family are played by
    being struck, shaken, or scraped. In the orchestra, the percussion section provides a variety of rhythms, textures
    and tone colors. Percussion instruments are classified as tuned or un-tuned. Tuned instruments play specific pitches
    or notes, just like the woodwind, brass and string instruments. Un-tuned instruments produce a sound with an
    indefinite pitch, like the sound of a hand knocking on a door. The percussion instruments are an international
    family, with ancestors from the Middle East, Asia, Africa, the Americas and Europe, representing musical styles from
    many different cultures.</p>
<a id="Timpani"></a>
<h3>Timpani</h3>
<p>Timpani, also known as kettledrums, were the first drums to be used in the orchestra over 300 years ago. They are
    constructed of a large copper bowl with a drumhead made of calfskin or plastic stretched across the top. When struck
    with felt- tipped wooden sticks, or mallets, timpani produce a specific pitch that is determined by the drum’s size.
    That pitch is fine-tuned by tightening the drumhead with keys and foot pedals. Most orchestras use three or four
    timpani of varying sizes.</p>

<a id="Bass Drum"></a>
<h3>Bass Drum</h3>
<p>The composer Mozart added the deep, booming, un- tuned sound of the bass drum to the orchestra in 1782. Constructed
    like a snare drum, but without snares, the bass drum is much larger and is played on its side, so that either head
    may be struck. The beater or mallet for a bass drum is large with a soft material such as sheep’s wool covering the
    end.</p>

<a id="Snare Drum"></a>
<h3>Snare Drum</h3>
<p>The snare drum joined the orchestra nearly 200 years ago. It has two calfskin or plastic drumheads stretched tightly
    over a hollow metal frame. The top head is struck with wooden drumsticks, and is called the batter-head. The bottom
    head or snare-head has catgut or metal wires called snares stretched tightly across it. When this un-tuned drum is
    struck on the top head, the snares produce a characteristic sharp rattling sound as they vibrate against the bottom
    head.</p>

<a id="Glockenspiel"></a>
<h3>Glockenspiel</h3>
<p>Also called orchestra bells, the glockenspiel resembles a small xylophone, but it is made of steel bars. The
    glockenspiel is typically played with wooden or plastic mallets, producing a high tuned sound that is bright and
    penetrating. The name glockenspiel comes from the German language and means “to play the bells.”</p>

<a id="Tubular Bells"></a>
<h3>Tubular Bells</h3>
<p>Tubular Bells (also Known as chimes) are musical instruments in the percussion family. Each bell is a metal tube,
    30–38 mm (1¼–1½ inches) in diameter, tuned by altering its length. Its standard range is from C4-F5, though many
    professional instruments reach G5 (see photo). Tubular bells are often replaced by studio chimes, which are a
    smaller and usually less expensive</p>
<p>instrument. Studio chimes are similar in appearance to tubular bells, but each bell has a smaller diameter than the
    corresponding bell on tubular bells.</p>

<a id="Xylophone"></a>
<h3>Xylophone</h3>
<p>The xylophone (from the Greek words ξύλον — xylon, “wood” + υωνή —phonē, “Sound, voice”, meaning “wooden sound”) is a
    musical instrument in the percussion family that consists of wooden (not steel) bars struck by mallets. Each bar is
    an idiophone tuned to a pitch of a musical scale, whether pentatonic or heptatonic in the case of many African and
    Asian instruments, diatonic in many western children’s instruments, or chromatic for orchestral use. The term may be
    used generally, to include all such instruments, such as the marimba and balafon or, more specifically, to refer to
    an orchestral instrument of somewhat higher pitch range than the chromatic marimba. It is sometimes mistakenly used
    of similar lithophones and metallophone instruments of the glockenspiel type such as the pixiphone.</p>

<a id="Hammered Dulcimer"></a>
<h3>Hammered Dulcimer</h3>
<p>The hammered dulcimer is a stringed musical instrument with the strings stretched over a trapezoidal sounding board.
    Typically, the hammered dulcimer is set on a stand, at an angle, before the musician, who holds small mallet hammers
    in each hand to strike the strings (cf. Appalachian dulcimer). The Graeco-Roman dulcimer (sweet song), derives from
    the Latin dulcis (sweet) and the Greek melos (song). The dulcimer’s origin is uncertain, but tradition holds it was
    invented in Mesopotamia, as the Iraqi Santur some 2000 years ago.</p>
<a id="Celesta"></a>
<h3>Celesta</h3>
<p>The celesta (/sɨ ˈlɛ stə/) or celeste (/sɨ ˈlɛ st/) is a struck idiophone operated by a keyboard. Its appearance is
    similar to that of an upright piano (four- or five-octave) or of a large wooden music box (three- octave). The keys
    are connected to hammers which strike a graduated set of metal (usually steel) plates suspended over wooden
    resonators. On four or five octave models one pedal is usually available to sustain or dampen the sound. The
    three-octave instruments do not have a pedal because of their small “table-top” design. One of the best-known works
    that makes use of the celesta is Tchaikovsky’s “Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy” from The Nutcracker.</p>

<a id="Zither"></a>
<h3>Zither</h3>
<p>The zither is a musical string instrument, most commonly found in Slovenia, Austria, Hungary, northwestern Croatia,
    the southern regions of Germany, alpine Europe and East Asian cultures, including China. The term “citre” is also
    used more broadly, to describe the entire family of stringed instruments in which the strings do not extend beyond
    the sounding box, including the hammered dulcimer, psaltery, Appalachian dulcimer, guqin, guzheng (Chinese zither),
    koto, gusli, kantele, gayageum, đàn tranh, kanun, autoharp, santoor, yangqin, piano, harpsichord, santur,
    swarmandal, and others. Modern electric zithers exist, as well as a wide variation of experimental zithers like the
    Kitaras of Harry Partch, the Shruti Stick and the Moodswinger. It is played by strumming or plucking the strings
    like a guitar.</p>
<a id="Tambourine"></a>
<h3>Tambourine</h3>
<p>The tambourine or marine (commonly called tambo) is a musical instrument of the percussion family consisting of a
    frame, often of wood or plastic, with pairs of small metal jingles, called “zils”. Classically the term tambourine
    denotes an instrument with a drumhead, though some variants may not have a head at all. Tambourines are often used
    with regular percussion sets. They can be mounted, but position is largely down to preference.</p>

<a id="Castanets"></a>
<h3>Castanets</h3>
<p>Castanets are a percussion instrument (idiophone), used in Moorish, Ottoman, ancient Roman, Italian, Spanish,
    Sephardic Music, and Portuguese music. The instrument consists of a pair of concave shells joined on one edge by a
    string. They are held in the hand and used to produce clicks for rhythmic accents or a ripping or rattling sound
    consisting of a rapid series of clicks. They are traditionally made of hardwood, although fibreglass is becoming
    increasingly popular.</p>

<a id="Triangle"></a>
<h3>Triangle</h3>
<p>The triangle is an idiophone type of musical instrument in the percussion family. It is a bar of metal, usually steel
    but sometimes other metals like beryllium copper, bent into a triangle shape. The instrument is usually held by a
    loop of some form of thread or wire at the top curve. It was first made around the 16th century.</p>

<a id="Woodblock"></a>
<h3>Woodblock</h3>
<p>A woodblock is essentially a small piece of slit drum made from a single piece of wood and used as a percussion
    instrument. It is struck with a stick, making a characteristically percussive sound.</p>
<a id="Rattle"></a>
<h3>Rattle</h3>
<p>A rattle is a percussion instrument. It consists of a hollow body filled with small uniform solid objects, like sand
    or nuts. Rhythmical shaking of this instrument produces repetitive, rather dry timbre noises. In some kinds of
    music, a rattle assumes the role of the metronome, as an alternative to the drum. In Urdu it is known by the name
    ‘chankana’.This instrument was used in the ancient world. Today it plays a role in Cha Cha Cha, tango and jazz.</p>

<a id="Cymbals"></a>
<h3>Cymbals</h3>
<p>Cymbals are a common percussion instrument. Cymbals consist of thin, normally round plates of various alloys; see
    cymbal making for a discussion of their manufacture. The greater majority of cymbals are of indefinite pitch,
    although small disc-shaped cymbals based on ancient designs sound a definite note (see: crotales). Cymbals are used
    in many ensembles ranging from the orchestra, percussion ensembles, jazz bands, heavy metal bands, and marching
    groups. Drum kits usually incorporate a crash, ride or crash ride, and a pair of hi-hat cymbals.</p>

<a id="Gong"></a>
<h3>Gong</h3>
<p>A gong (Malay: gong) is an East and South East Asian musical percussion instrument that takes the form of a flat
    metal disc which is hit with a mallet.Gongs are broadly of three types. Suspended gongs are more or less flat,
    circular discs of metal suspended vertically by means of a cord passed through holes near to the top rim. Bossed or
    nipple gongs have a raised centre boss and are often suspended and played horizontally. Bowl gongs are bowl- shaped,
    and rest on cushions and belong more to bells than gongs. Gongs are made mainly from bronze or brass but there are
    many other alloys in use.</p>
