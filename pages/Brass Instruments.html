<p>Brass family instruments produce their unique sound by the player buzzing his/her lips while blowing air through a
    cup- or funnel-shaped mouthpiece. To produce higher or lower pitches, the player adjusts the opening between his/her
    lips. The mouthpiece connects to a length of brass tubing ending in a bell. The shorter the tubing length, the
    smaller the instrument, and the higher the sound; and the longer the tubing length, the larger the instrument, and
    the lower the sound. The brass family can trace its ancestry back to herald trumpets, hunting horns, and military
    bugles. The main instruments of the brass family include the Trumpet, Horn, Trombone, Cornet and Tuba.</p>
<a id="Trumpet"></a><h3>Trumpet</h3>
<p>The Trumpet is the highest sounding member of the brass family. The brilliant tone of the trumpet travels through
    about 6 - ½ feet of tubing bent into an oblong shape. The player presses the three valves in various combinations
    with the fingers of the right hand to obtain various pitches.</p>

<p>The horn or French horn consists of about 12 feet of narrow tubing wound into a circle. The player obtains different
    notes on the horn with a clear mellow sound by pressing valves with the left hand and by moving the right hand
    inside of the bell.</p>

<a id="Trombone"></a><h3>Trombone</h3>
<p>The mouthpiece of the Trombone is larger than that of a trumpet, and gives the instrument a more mellow sound.
    Instead of valves, the trombone has a slide which changes the length of its approximately 9 feet of tubing to reach
    different pitches. The Trombone can play a complete chromatic scale.</p>

<p>The cornet is a brass instrument very similar to the trumpet, distinguished by its conical bore, compact shape, and
    mellower tone quality. The most common cornet is a transposing instrument in B♭. It is not related to the
    renaissance and early baroque cornett or cornetto.</p>

<p>Made of about 16 feet of tubing, the Tuba is the lowest sounding member of the brass family. The tuba has four to
    five valves and is held upright in the player’s lap.</p>
