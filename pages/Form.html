<p>The term musical form refers to the overall structure or plan of a piece of music, and it describes the layout of a
    composition as divided into sections. In the tenth edition of The Oxford Companion to Music, Percy Scholes defines
    musical form as “a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of
    unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration.”</p>
<a id="Binary Form AB Form"></a>
<h3>Binary Form (AB Form)</h3>
<p>Most strictly, a piece in binary form is characterized by two complementary, related sections of roughly equal
    duration, which come up frequently. The first section will start in a certain key, and will usually modulate to a
    related key:</p>
<p>Compositions in major keys will typically modulate to the dominant (V), the fifth scale degree above the tonic</p>
<p>Compositions in minor keys will typically modulate to the relative major, the major key centered on the third scale
    degree above the tonic; alternatively the first section could close in the dominant minor, or with an imperfect
    cadence in the original key.</p>
<p>The second section of the piece begins in the newly established key, where it remains for an indefinite period of
    time. After some harmonic activity, the piece will eventually modulate back to its original key before ending. More
    often than not, especially in 18th-century compositions, the A and B sections are separated by double bars with
    repeat signs, meaning both sections were to be repeated.</p>

<h3>Ternary Form (ABA Form)</h3>
<p>Ternary form, sometimes called song form, is a three-part musical form, usually schematized as A-B-A. The first and
    third parts (A) are musically identical, or very nearly so, while the second part (B) in some way provides a
    contrast with them. The B section is often called the trio, especially in minuets and scherzi.</p>
<a id="Rondo Form ABACADA Form"></a>
<h3>Rondo Form (ABACADA Form)</h3>
<p>In rondo form, a principal theme (sometimes called the “refrain”) alternates with one or more contrasting themes,
    generally called “episodes,” but also occasionally referred to as “digressions” or “couplets.” Possible patterns in
    the Classical period include: ABA, ABACA, ABACADA or ABACABA. The number of themes can vary from piece to piece, and
    the recurring element is sometimes embellished and/or shortened in order to provide for variation.</p>
<a id="Air With Variations"></a>
<h3>Air With Variations</h3>
<p>A musical variation form which uses techniques such as: Varied Harmonization, Ornamentation, Modulation, Change of
    Tempo and Rhythm, Diminution and Augmentation.</p>
<a id="Sonata Form 1st Movement Form"></a>
<h3>Sonata Form (1st Movement Form)</h3>
<p>A sonata-allegro movement is divided into sections. Each section is felt to perform specific functions in the musical
    argument.</p>
<p>It may begin with an introduction, which is, in general, slower than the main movement. In terms of structure,
    introductions are an upbeat before the main musical argument.</p>
<p>The first required section is the exposition. The exposition presents the primary thematic material for the movement:
    one or two themes or theme groups, often in contrasting styles and in opposing keys, connected by a modulating
    transition. The exposition typically ends with a closing theme, a codetta, or both.</p>
<p>The exposition is followed by the development where the harmonic and textural possibilities of the thematic material
    are explored.</p>
<p>The development then re-transitions back to the recapitulation where the thematic material returns in the tonic key,
    and for the recapitulation to complete the musical argument, material that has not been stated in the tonic key is
    “resolved” by being played, in whole or in part, in the tonic.</p>
<p>The movement may conclude with a coda, beyond the final cadence of the recapitulation.</p>
