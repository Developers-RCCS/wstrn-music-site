    Baroque music describes a style of Western Classical music approximately
    extending from 1600 to 1760. This era follows the Renaissance and
    was followed in turn by the Classical era. The word “baroque” came
    from the Portuguese word barroco, meaning “misshapen pearl” a
    negative description of the ornate and heavily ornamented music of
    this period; later, the name came to be applied also to its
    architecture.
</p>
<p>
    Baroque music forms a major portion of the classical music canon, being
    widely studied, performed, and listened to. Composers of the baroque
    era include Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frideric Handel,
    Alessandro Scarlatti, Antonio Vivaldi, Georg Philipp Telemann,
    Jean-Baptiste Lully, Arcangelo Corelli, Claudio Monteverdi,
    Jean-Philippe Rameau and Henry Purcell.

<p>
    The baroque period saw the development of functional tonality. During
    the period, composers and performers used more elaborate musical
    ornamentation, made changes in musical notation, and developed new
    instrumental playing techniques. Baroque music expanded the size,
    range, and complexity of instrumental performance, and also
    established opera as a musical genre. Many musical terms and
    concepts from this era are still being used in the current world.

<img src="assets/media/Image-5.jpg"><img src="assets/media/Image-4.png">
<p>
    Johann Sebastian Bach, born on the 1st of March 1685 (died on 28 July 1750)
    was a German composer and organist whose ecclesiastical and secular
    works for choir, orchestra, and solo instruments drew together the
    strands of the Baroque period and brought it to its ultimate
    maturity. Although he introduced no new forms, he enriched the
    prevailing German style with a robust contrapuntal technique, an
    unrivalled control of harmonic and motivic organization, and the
    adaptation of rhythms, forms and textures from abroad, particularly
    Italy and France.
</p>
<p>
    Revered for their intellectual depth, technical command and artistic beauty,
    Bach’s works include the Brandenburg concertos, the Goldberg
    Variations, the Partitas, the Well-Tempered Clavier, the Mass in B
    Minor, the St. Matthew Passion, the St. John Passion, the
    Magnificat, The Musical Offering, The Art of Fugue, the English and
    French Suites, the Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin, the Cello
    Suites, more than 200 surviving cantatas, and a similar number of
    organ works, including the celebrated Toccata and Fugue in D minor
    and Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor.
</p>
<p>
    Bach’s abilities as an organist were highly respected throughout Europe
    during his lifetime, although he was not widely recognized as a
    great composer until a revival of interest and performances of his
    music in the first half of the 19th century. He is now regarded as
    the supreme composer of the Baroque, and as one of the greatest of
    all time.

<a id="George Frideric Handel"></a><h3>George Frideric Handel</h3>
<img src="assets/media/Image-3.jpg"><img src="assets/media/Image-2.png">
<p>
    George Frideric Handel (23 February 1685 – 14 April 1759) was a
    German-English Baroque composer, who is famous for his operas,
    oratorios, and concerti grossi. His life and music may justly be
    described as “cosmopolitan”: he was born in Germany, trained in
    Italy, and spent most of his life in England. Born in Halle in the
    Duchy of Magdeburg, he settled in England in 1712, becoming a
    naturalized subject of the British crown on 22 January 1727.His
    works include Messiah, Water Music, and Music for the Royal
    Fireworks. Strongly influenced by the techniques of the great
    composers of the Italian Baroque era, as well as the English
    composer Henry Purcell, Handel’s music became well-known to many
    composers, including Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven.
</p>
<p>
    Handel’s compositions include 42 operas; 29 oratorios; more than 120
    cantatas, trios and duets; numerous arias; chamber music; a large
    number of ecumenical pieces; odes and serenatas; and 16 organ
    concerti. His most famous work, the Messiah oratorio with its
    “Hallelujah” chorus, is among the most popular works in choral music
    and has become a centerpiece of the Christmas season. Also popular
    are the Opus 3 and 6 Concerti Grossi, as well as “The Cuckoo and the
    Nightingale”, in which birds are heard calling during passages
    played in different keys representing the vocal ranges of two birds.
    Also notable are his sixteen keyboard suites, Most importantly The
    Harmonious Blacksmith.
</p>
<p>
    Handel introduced various previously uncommon musical instruments in his
    works: the viola d’amore and violetta marina (Orlando), the lute
    (Ode for St. Cecilia’s Day), three trombones (Saul), clarinets or
    small high cornets (Tamerlano), theorbo, French horn (Water Music),
    lyrichord, double bassoon, viola da gamba, bell chimes, positive
    organ, and harp (Giulio Cesare, Alexander’s Feast).
</p>
<p>
    Handel’s works have been catalogued and are commonly referred to by a HWV
    number. For example, Handel’s Messiah is also known as HWV 56.

    Giuseppe Domenico Scarlatti (October 26, 1685 – July 23, 1757) was an Italian
    composer who spent much of his life in the service of the Portuguese
    and Spanish royal families. He is classified as a Baroque composer
    chronologically, although his music was influential in the
    development of the Classical style. His influential 555 sonatas were
    almost all written for the harpsichord with a few exceptions for
    chamber ensemble or organ. He was the son of composer Alessandro
    Scarlatti

    The many sonatas which were unpublished during Scarlatti’s lifetime have
    appeared in print irregularly in the two and a half centuries since.
    Scarlatti has, however, attracted notable admirers, including
    Frédéric Chopin, Johannes Brahms, Béla Bartók, Dmitri Shostakovich,
    Heinrich Schenker, Vladimir Horowitz and Marc- André Hamelin. The
    Russian school of pianism has particularly championed the sonatas.

<a id="Antonio lucio Vivaldi"></a><h3>Antonio lucio Vivaldi</h3>
<img src="assets/media/Image-5.jpg"><img src="assets/media/Image-4.png">
<p>
    Antonio Lucio Vivaldi (4 March 1678 – 28 July 1741), nicknamed il Prete
    Rosso (“The Red Priest”) because of his red hair, was an Italian
    Baroque composer, priest, and virtuoso violinist, born in Venice.
    Vivaldi is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque composers, and
    his influence during his lifetime was widespread over Europe.
    Vivaldi is known mainly for composing instrumental concertos,
    especially for the violin, as well as sacred choral works and over
    40 operas. His best known work is a series of violin concertos known
    as The Four Seasons.
</p>
<p>
    Many of his compositions were written for the female music ensemble of the
    Ospedale della Pietà, a home for abandonedchildren where Vivaldi
    worked from 1703 to 1715 and from 1723 to 1740. Vivaldi also had
    some success with stagings of his operas in Venice, Mantua and
    Vienna. After meeting the Emperor Charles VI, Vivaldi moved to
    Vienna hoping for preferment. The Emperor died soon after Vivaldi’s
    arrival, and the composer died a pauper, without a steady source of
    income.
</p>
<p>
    Though Vivaldi’s music was well received during his lifetime, it later
    declined in popularity until its vigorous revival in the first half
    of the 20th century. Today, Vivaldi ranks among the most popular and
    widely recorded Baroque composers.
