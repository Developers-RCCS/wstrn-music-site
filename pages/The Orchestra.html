<p>An orchestra is a sizable instrumental ensemble that contains sections of string, brass, woodwind, and percussion
    instruments. The term orchestra derives from the Greek οπχήστπα, the name for the area in front of an ancient
    Greek stage reserved for the Greek chorus. The orchestra grew by accretion throughout the 18th and 19th
    centuries, but changed very little in composition during the course of the 20th century.</p>
<p>A smaller-sized orchestra for this time period (of about fifty players or fewer) is called a chamber orchestra. A
    full-size orchestra (about 100 players) may sometimes be called a “symphony orchestra” or “philharmonic
    orchestra”; these modifiers do not necessarily indicate any strict difference in either the instrumental
    constitution or role of the orchestra, but can be useful to distinguish different ensembles based in the same
    city (for instance, the London Symphony Orchestra and the London Philharmonic Orchestra). A symphony orchestra
    will usually have over eighty musicians on its roster, in some cases over a hundred, but the actual number of
    musicians employed in a particular performance may vary according to the work being played and the size of the
    venue. A leading chamber orchestra might employ as many as fifty musicians; some are much smaller than that.
    Orchestras can also be found in schools. The term concert orchestra may sometimes be used (e.g., BBC Concert
    Orchestra; RTÉ Concert Orchestra)—no distinction is made on size of orchestra by use of this term, although
    their use is generally distinguished as for live concert. As such they are commonly chamber orchestras.</p>
