<p>At the turn of the century, music was characteristically late Romantic in style. Composers such as Gustav Mahler and
    Jean Sibelius were pushing the bounds of Post-Romantic Symphonic writing. At the same time, the Impressionist
    movement, spearheaded by Claude Debussy, was being developed in France. The term was actually loathed by Debussy: “I
    am trying to do 'something different—in a way realities—what the imbeciles call ‘impressionism’ is a term which is
    as poorly used as possible, particularly by art critics” (Politoske 1988, 419)—and Maurice Ravel’s music, also often
    labeled with this term, explores music in many styles not always related to it.</p>

<h3>George Gershwin</h3>

<p>George Gershwin (September 26, 1898 – July 11, 1937) was an American composer and pianist. Gershwin’s compositions
    spanned both popular and classical genres, and his most popular melodies are universally familiar.</p>
<p>He wrote most of his vocal and theatrical works, including more than a dozen Broadway shows, in collaboration with
    his elder brother, lyricistIra Gershwin. George Gershwin composed music for Broadway and the classical concert hall,
    as well as popular songs that brought his work to an even wider public. His compositions have been used in numerous
    films and on television, and many became jazz standards recorded in numerous variations. Countless singers and
    musicians have recorded Gershwin songs.</p>
<p>In 1975, Columbia Records released an album featuring Gershwin’s piano rolls of the Rhapsody In Blue, accompanied by
    the Columbia Jazz Band playing the original jazz-band accompaniment, conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas. The flip
    side of the Columbia Masterworks release features Tilson Thomas leading the New York Philharmonic in An American in
    Paris.</p>

<h3>Sergei Prokofiev</h3>

<p>Sergei Sergeyevich Prokofiev (27 April 1891 – 5 March 1953) was a Russiancomposer, pianist and conductor who mastered
    numerous musical genres and came to be admired as one of the greatest composers of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Prokofiev was a soloist with the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Piero Coppola, in the first recording of his
    Piano Concerto No. 3, recorded in London by His Master’s Voice in June 1932. Prokofiev also recorded some of his
    solo piano music for HMV in Paris in February 1935; these recordings were issued on CD by Pearl and Naxos.[66] In
    1938, he conducted the Moscow</p>
<p>Philharmonic Orchestra in a recording of the second suite from his Romeo and Juliet ballet; this performance was also
    later released on LP and CD. Another reported recording with Prokofiev and the Moscow Philharmonic was of the First
    Violin Concerto with David Oistrakh as soloist; Everest Records later released this recording on an LP.</p>

<h3>Béla Bartók</h3>
<img src="./assets/media/image-15.png">
<p>Béla Viktor János Bartók (March 25, 1881 – September 26, 1945) was a Hungariancomposer and pianist. He is considered
    to be one of the greatest composers of the 20th century and is regarded, along with Liszt, as his country’s greatest
    composer (Gillies 2001). Through his collection and analytical study of folk music, he was one of the founders of
    ethnomusicology.</p>
<p>Bartók’s music reflects two trends that dramatically changed the sound of music in the 20th century: the breakdown of
    the diatonic system of harmony that had served composers for the previous two hundred years (Griffiths, 7); and the
    revival of nationalism as a source for musical inspiration, a trend that began with Mikhail Glinka and Antonín
    Dvořák in the last half of the 19th century (Einstein, 332). In his search for new forms of tonality, Bartók turned
    to Hungarian folk music, as well as to other folk music of the Carpathian Basin and even of Algeria and Turkey; and
    in so doing he became influential in that stream of modernism which exploited indigenous music and techniques
    (Botstein, 6).</p>

<h3>Igor Stravinsky</h3>
<img src="./assets/media/image-20.jpg"><img src="./assets/media/image-19.png">
<p>Igor Fyodorovich Stravinsky (17 June 1882 – 6 April 1971) was a Russiancomposer, pianist, and conductor, widely
    acknowledged as one of the most important and influential composers of 20th century music. He was a quintessentially
    cosmopolitan Russian who was named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people of the century. In
    addition to the recognition he received for his compositions, he also achieved fame as a pianist and a conductor,
    often at the premieres of his works.</p>
<p>Stravinsky’s compositional career was notable for its stylistic diversity. He first achieved international fame with
    three ballets commissioned by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev and performed by Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes (Russian
    Ballets): The Firebird (1910), Petrushka (1911/1947), and The Rite of Spring (1913). The Rite, whose premiere
    provoked a riot, transformed the way in which subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure, and was largely
    responsible for Stravinsky’s enduring reputation as a musical revolutionary, pushing the boundaries of musical
    design.</p>
<p>After this first Russian phase Stravinsky turned to neoclassicism in the 1920s. The works from this period tended to
    make use of traditional musical forms (concerto grosso, fugue, symphony), frequently concealed a vein of intense
    emotion beneath a surface appearance of detachment or austerity, and often paid tribute to the music of earlier
    masters, for example J. S. Bach and Tchaikovsky. In the 1950s he adopted serial procedures, using the new techniques
    over his last twenty years. Stravinsky’s compositions of this period share traits with all of his earlier output:
    rhythmic energy, the construction of extended melodic ideas out of a few two- or three-note cells, and clarity of
    form, of instrumentation, and of utterance.</p>
<p>He also published a number of books throughout his career, almost always with the aid of a collaborator, sometimes
    uncredited. In his 1936 autobiography, Chronicles of My Life, written with the help of Walter Nouvel, Stravinsky
    included his infamous statement that “music is, by its very nature, essentially powerless to express anything at
    all.” With Alexis Roland-Manuel and Pierre Souvtchinsky he wrote his 1939–40 Harvard UniversityCharles Eliot Norton
    Lectures, which were delivered in French and later collected under the title Poétique musicale in 1942 (translated
    in 1947 as Poetics of Music).</p>

<h3>Benjamin Britten</h3>

<p>Edward Benjamin Britten, Baron Britten, OMCH (22 November 1913 – 4 December 1976) was an Englishcomposer, conductor,
    violist and pianist. Britten was an accomplished pianist, frequently performing chamber music and accompanying
    lieder and song recitals. However, apart from the Holiday Diary (1934), Piano Concerto (1938), Young Apollo (1939),
    Diversions (written for Paul Wittgenstein in 1940), Scottish Ballad (1941), he wrote relatively little music that
    puts the piano in the spotlight, and in a 1963 interview for the BBC said that he thought of it as “a background
    instrument”.</p>
<p>One of Britten’s best known works is The Young Person’s Guide to the Orchestra (1946), which was composed to
    accompany Instruments of the Orchestra, an educational film produced by the British government, narrated and
    conducted by Malcolm Sargent. Its subtitle is Variations and Fugue on a Theme of Purcell, the theme is a melody from
    Henry Purcell’s Abdelazar. Britten gives individual variations to each of the sections of the orchestra, starting
    with the woodwind, then the string instruments, the brass instruments and finally the percussion. Britten then
    brings the whole orchestra together again in a fugue before restating the theme to close the work. The original
    film’s spoken commentary is often omitted in concert performances and recordings</p>
