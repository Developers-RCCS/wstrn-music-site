<p>Keyboard instruments are often classified as percussion instruments because they play a rhythmic role in some music.
    However, most keyboard instruments are not true members of the percussion family because their sound is not produced
    by the vibration of a membrane or solid material. Among the earliest keyboard instruments are the pipe organ,
    clavichord, and harpsichord.</p>
<a id="Harpsichord"></a><h3>Harpsichord</h3>
<p>The Harpsichord is an early relative of the piano. Although it looks like a piano, it sounds much different. Small
    hooks called quills pluck the strings when the player’s hand presses a key on the keyboard. In the narrow sense,
    “harpsichord” designates only the large wing-shaped instruments in which the strings are perpendicular to the
    keyboard. In a broader sense, “harpsichord” designates the whole family of similar plucked keyboard instruments,
    including the smaller virginals, muselar, and spinet. The harpsichord was widely used in Renaissance and Baroque
    music. During the late 18th century it gradually disappeared from the musical scene with the rise of the piano. But
    in the 20th century it made resurgence, used in historically informed performance of older music, in new
    (contemporary) compositions, and in popular culture.</p>

<a id="Clavichord"></a><h3>Clavichord</h3>
<p>The Clavichord is a European stringed keyboard instrument known from the late Medieval, through the Renaissance,
    Baroque and Classical eras. Historically, it was widely used as a practice instrument and as an aid to composition,
    not being loud enough for larger performances. The clavichord produces sound by striking brass or iron strings with
    small metal blades called tangents. Vibrations are transmitted through the bridge(s) to the soundboard. The name is
    derived from the Latin word clavis, meaning “key” and chorda meaning “string, especially of a musical instrument”.

<a id="Piano"></a><h3>Piano</h3>
<p>The Piano was revolutionary because a pianist could vary the volume (or dynamics) of the sound by varying the vigor
    with which each key was struck. The piano’s full name is “gravicèmbalo con piano e forte” meaning “harpsichord with
    soft and loud” but can be shortened to “piano-forte”, which means “soft-loud” in Italian. Sound is produced on the
    piano by small hammers striking strings. The hammers are controlled mechanically and strike the strings when the
    player’s hands press the piano keys. Pressing a key on the piano’s keyboard causes a felt-covered hammer to strike
    steel strings. The hammers rebound, allowing the strings to continue vibrating. When the key is released, a damper
    stops the string’s vibration. The invention of the modern piano is credited to Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655 - 1731).
    Grand pianos have three pedals: the soft pedal (una corda), sustenuto, and sustain pedal (from left to right,
    respectively). Modern upright pianos also have three pedals: soft pedal, practice pedal and sustain pedal, though
    older or cheaper models may lack the practice pedal. The sustain pedal (or, damper pedal) lifts the dampers from all
    keys, sustaining all played notes. The soft pedal or una corda pedal is placed leftmost in the row of pedals. In
    grand pianos, it shifts the entire action, including the keyboard, to the right, so that the hammers hit only one of
    the three strings for each note (hence the name una corda, or ‘one string’). The effect is to soften the note as
    well as to change the tone. In uprights, the pedal moves the hammers closer to the strings, allowing the hammers to
    produce a softer sound, but with no change in timbre. On grand pianos, the middle pedal is a sustenuto pedal. This
    pedal keeps raised any damper that was already raised at the moment the pedal is depressed. This makes it possible
    to sustain some notes (by depressing the sustenuto pedal before notes to be sustained are released) while the
    player’s hands are free to play additional notes (which will not be sustained). This can be useful for musical
    passages with pedal points and other otherwise tricky or impossible situations. On many upright pianos, there is a
    middle pedal called the ‘practice’ or celeste pedal. This drops a piece of felt between the hammers and strings,
    greatly muting the sounds. Often this pedal can be shifted while depressed, into a “locking” position.</p>

<a id="Pipe Organ"></a><h3>Pipe Organ</h3>
<p>The pipe organ is a musical instrument that produces sound by driving pressurized air (called wind) through pipes
    selected via a keyboard. Because each organ pipe produces a single pitch, the pipes are provided in sets called
    ranks, each of which has a common timbre and volume throughout the keyboard compass. Most organs have multiple ranks
    of pipes of differing timbre, pitch and loudness that the player can employ singly or in combination through the use
    of controls called stops. A pipe organ has one or more keyboards (called manuals) played by the hands, and a
    pedalboard played by the feet, each of which has its own group of stops. The organ’s continuous supply of wind
    allows it to sustain notes for as long as the corresponding keys are depressed, unlike the piano and harpsichord,
    the sounds of which begin to decay the longer the keys are held. The smallest portable pipe organs may have only one
    or two dozen pipes and one manual; the biggest may have over 20,000 pipes and seven manuals. The origins of the pipe
    organ can be traced back to the hydraulis in Ancient Greece in the 3rd century BC, in which the wind supply was
    created with water pressure. By the sixth or 7th century AD, bellows were used to supply organs with wind. Beginning
    in the 12th century, the organ began to evolve into a complex instrument capable of producing different timbres. By
    the 17th century, most of the sounds available on the modern classical organ had been developed. From that time, the
    pipe organ was the most complex man- made device, a distinction it retained until it was displaced by the telephone
    exchange in the late 19th century. Pipe organs are installed in churches, synagogues, concert halls, and other
    public buildings and are used for the performance of classical music, sacred music, and secular music. In the early
    20th century, pipe organs were installed in theaters to accompany films during the silent movie era, in municipal
    auditoria, where orchestral transcriptions were popular, and in the homes of the wealthy, equipped with player
    mechanisms. The beginning of the 21st century has seen a resurgence in installations in concert halls. The organ
    boasts a substantial repertoire, which spans over 400 years.</p>

<a id="Virginal"></a><h3>Virginal</h3>
<p>The virginals or virginal (the plural form does not necessarily denote more than one instrument) is a keyboard
    instrument of the harpsichord family. It was popular in northern Europe and Italy during the late Renaissance and
    early baroque periods. The virginals is a smaller and simpler rectangular form of the harpsichord with only one
    string per note running more or less parallel to the keyboard on the long side of the case. Many, if not most, of
    the instruments were constructed without legs, and would be placed on a table for playing. Later models were built
    with their own stands.</p>
