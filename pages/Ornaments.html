<p>In music, ornaments or embellishments are musical flourishes that are not necessary to carry the overall line of the
    melody (or harmony), but serve instead to decorate or “ornament” that line.</p>
<a id="Trill"></a>
<h3>Trill</h3>
<p>A trill is a rapid alternation between an indicated note and the one above, also known as the shake.</p>
<p>The trill is indicated by either a or a ~~, with the ~ representing the length</p>
<p>of the trill, above the staff</p>
<p>There is also a single tone trill variously called trillo or</p>
<p>tremolo in late Renaissance and early Baroque.</p>

<a id="Mordent"></a>
<h3>Mordent</h3>
<p>The mordent is thought of as a rapid alternation between an indicated note, the note above (called the upper mordent,
    inverted mordent, or pralltriller) or below (called the lower mordent or mordent), and the indicated note again.</p>
<p>The upper mordent is indicated by a short squiggle (which may also indicate a trill); the lower mordent is the same
    with a short vertical line through it:</p>
<p>As with the trill, the exact speed with which the mordent is performed will vary according to the tempo of the piece,
    but, at a moderate tempo, the above might be executed as follows:</p>

<a id="Turn"></a>
<h3>Turn</h3>
<p>A short figure consisting of the note above the one indicated, the note itself, the note below the one indicated, and
    the note itself again. It is marked by a mirrored S-shape lying on its side above the staff.</p>
<p>The details of its execution depend partly on the exact placement of the turn mark. The following turns:</p>
<p>might be executed like this:</p>

<a id="Appoggiatura"></a>
<h3>Appoggiatura</h3>
<p>Appoggiatura (English pronunciation:/əˈpɒ dʒ əˈtjʊ ərə/ ,Italian: [appoddʒ aˈtuˈra]) comes from the Italian verb
    appoggiare, “to lean upon”. The long appoggiatura (as opposed to the short appoggiatura, the acciaccatura) is
    important melodically and often suspends the principal note by taking away the time-value of the appoggiatura
    prefixed to it (generally half the time value of the note, though in triple time, for example, it might receive two
    thirds of the time). The added note (the unessential note) is one degree higher or lower than the principal note;
    and, if lower, it may or may not be chromatically raised (see mordent).</p>
<p>The appoggiatura is written as a grace note prefixed to a principal note and printed in small character, usually
    without the oblique stroke:</p>
<p>This would be executed as follows:</p>

<h3>Acciaccatura</h3>
<p>Acciaccatura (English pronunciation:/əˈtʃ ækəˈtjʊ ərə/ ,Italian: [attʃ akkaˈtuˈra]) comes from the Italian verb
    acciaccare, “to crush”. The acciaccatura (sometimes called short appoggiatura) is perhaps best thought of as a
    shorter, less melodically significant, variant of the long appoggiatura, where the delay of the principal note is
    scarcely perceptible – theoretically subtracting no time at all. It is written using a grace note (often a quaver,
    or eighth note), with an oblique stroke through the stem:</p>
<p>The exact interpretation of this will vary according to the tempo of the piece, but the following is possible:</p>
